# **PyScheduler**

A unified Python module of CPU schedulers for educators and students, and for educational and simulation purposes.

---

## Why do this?

During my OS class, we are tasked to perform simulations of CPU scheduling algorithms in Python, and since there are no Python modules (as far as I know) for schedulers, I had to scour through the internet to look for sample implementation, and somehow refactor every algorithm that I need to fit my use case.

Because of this, it took me a few hours to perform the simulation. It could've been far more faster if there was a module, and our teacher could've provide a demo as well.

So I took the initiative in starting this project, and thought of it as my first ever open source project to give back to the community.

This project will also be a platform for me (I hope it does for you too), to practice my coding skills and strengthen our OS scheduling knowledge.
